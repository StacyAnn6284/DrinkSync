      <h3>What We Offer</h3>
      <h4>Ingredient Based Cocktail Search</h4>
      <p>
        We know how frustrating it can be to search for cocktail recipes only to
        find out you're missing the most important ingredient. Our search
        feature allows you to find cocktail recipes based on the ingredients you
        have on hand. Simply enter what's already in your cupboard, and we'll
        provide you with a list of cocktails you can create today.
      </p>
      <h4>Search By Cocktail Name</h4>
      <p>
        Want to find a specific cocktail you've enjoyed at your favorite bar or
        one you've heard your friends talking about? Use our search by cocktail
        name feature to find exactly what you're looking for. Whether it's a
        classic Old Fashioned or a latest trendy Martini, we've got you covered
        with detailed instructions to bring the favorites to your very own
        kitchen.
      </p>
      <h4>Missing an ingredient?</h4>
      <p>
        Missing an ingredient or running low on an item, but don't have the time
        or money to run to the store? We've got you covered. Our ingredient
        substitute search will help you find alternates so you don't have any
        interruptions, and can get back to creating what you love. Discover how
        to swap out items in your pantry and still enjoy wallet-friendly drinks.
